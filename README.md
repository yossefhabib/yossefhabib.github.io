## Projects

### Completed
 
| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Homelab Host Build](https://github.com/yossefhabib/HomelabWorkstationBuild) | This project documents the design, assembly, configuration, and validation of a high-performance Windows 11 Pro workstation built to support multi-VM cybersecurity lab environments, defensive security testing, and SOC-focused practice. |
| [Hyper-V Kali Linux VM Setup](https://github.com/yossefhabib/HyperVSetUp) | Deployed and architected an isolated Kali Linux cybersecurity lab using Microsoft Hyper-V on Windows 11 Pro, incorporating network segmentation, resource optimization, and integrity verification to establish a secure foundation for Active Directory attack simulations and SOC practice environments. |
| [Subnet Configuration & ICMP Validation](https://github.com/yossefhabib/Netconfig) | This lab demonstrates building a functional isolated network in Hyper-V by configuring static IPv4 addressing across Windows and Linux VMs, validating connectivity, adjusting firewall rules, and preparing foundational infrastructure for Active Directory and SIEM deployment. |


### Planned Security Labs

| Project | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Splunk SIEM Lab  | Planned | Enterprise SIEM deployment with Splunk, Sysmon endpoint telemetry, 4 custom detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, SOC dashboard, and full attack simulation with documented incident response. |
| Active Directory Lab | Planned | Windows Server domain with log forwarding to SIEM, attack simulation using Atomic Red Team |
| SOAR Automation | Planned | Integrate Wazuh with Shuffle for automated incident response playbooks |
| EDR Integration | Planned | Deploy Lima Charlie with Tines SOAR for endpoint detection and response |
